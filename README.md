# Lets-go-on-an-adventure
This program is basically a story telling adventure with some rng elements added on who joins you on each adventure and being able to guess the number to get through the event that the user is currently in

This is a program I wrote the winter break after I took my first ever programming class

I was looking for a project to build that I was capable of building given my knowledge at the time and figured that I could write one based on the experiences my friend group and I experienced throughout the first semester of our freshman year

All the events within this program did actually happen, some of them include some inside jokes

I might rewrite this at some point
